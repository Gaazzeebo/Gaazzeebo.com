            <p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information. These measures include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Encryption technologies for data at rest and in transit.</li>
                <li>Access controls that limit access to personal information to employees who need to know that information to operate, develop, or improve our services.</li>

                <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> With third parties who provide services on our behalf, like payment processing, data analysis, email delivery, hosting services, customer service, and marketing assistance.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal Reasons:</strong> When we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.</li>
                <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company.</li>
            </ul>  
        <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We will retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>

        <h2>8. Security</h2>
        <p>We strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, but remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

        <h2>9. Your Rights Under GDPR and CCPA</h2>
        <p>If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), you have certain data protection rights. If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) provides you with specific rights regarding your personal information. These include:</p>

        </ul>

        <h2>10. Do Not Track Signals</h2>
        <p>Our site does not currently respond to "Do Not Track" signals from web browsers, as there is no universally accepted standard for how companies should respond to such signals.</p>

        <h2>11. Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>Any disputes arising from this Privacy Policy will be governed by the laws of the State where Gaazzeebo LLC is headquartered, without regard to its conflict of law principles.

<p>This limitation applies regardless of whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other basis, even if Gaazzeebo has been advised of the possibility of such damages. In jurisdictions where the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages is not allowed, our liability is limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the aggregate liability of Gaazzeebo arising out of or in connection with this agreement or the services provided hereunder will not exceed the total amount paid by you to Gaazzeebo in the twelve (12) months period preceding the event giving rise to the claim, or if no such payments have been made, then the amount of $100.</p>
